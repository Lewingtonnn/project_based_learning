# Bootcamp Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my daily progress and learning from a backend-focused Python Bootcamp. The goal is to master topics like SQL, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Docker, APIs, and software engineering best practices.

I’m committing small projects and code snippets every day to track my growth, keep myself accountable, and build a public learning record.

## 📅 Daily Progress

| Day | Topic | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Day 1 | FastAPI Intro +Asyncio and aiohttp| Built my first FastAPI app with endpoints and auto docs.Also worked on the asyncio and aiohttp and compared async with sync programming |
| Day 2 | | Advanced FastAPI | Worked on dependencies, Background tasks, pydantic models and Validation, Response model and type hinting 
| Day 3 | PostgreSQL + FastAPI DB Integration| Set up Postgres in Docker, connected it to FastAPI. |
| Day 4 | ... | ... |

## 📌 Purpose

This is not a polished portfolio — this repo is for documenting **learning in public**. Later, I’ll build refined, client-ready projects in separate repositories.
